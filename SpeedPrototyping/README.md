# SpeedPrototyping

## School assignment lasting a total of 5 days with the following description:

>The games industry works incredibly fast and evolves constantly. This means that we need to be able to pick up knowledge fast and bring that knowledge to the table quickly. This is extremely important during the start of a project since we need to see if this project actually works and is fun.  
Each day we will talk about how it's been going and your implementations of the last feature. You will also be presented with a new assignment each day. This needs to be completed during the day. If you have time over you can always improve your design or structure. Make sure to try to be quick but also smart. Some features during the week might overlap.

### Assignments

#### Day 1: Rewinding Time
>Implement a feature where the player can choose to rewind time and it affects objects that have moved as well as being able to configure how long and fast we can rewind time.

#### Day 2: Enemy Patrol
>We need an enemy that patrol a route that consists of a configurable amount of points. Enemies should be able to see the player and if it does it should go to the player and when they reach you, DEATH. Enemies need to be able to hear the player if you are sprinting and then move towards that location.

#### Day 3: Enemy Rewinding
>The enemy needs to be able to work in the rewinding system. I also want the rewind system to have support for rewinding one specific object that I am targeting.

#### Day 4: TimeShot
>Upgrading the Rewind system. We need to be able to take snapshots of our worlds. This is a "timeshot" so we save a point in time. We should be able to jump back into this time.

#### Day 5: Objective
>We need some type of a objective system. Could you make 10 flags that spawns randomly around the map that you need to pickup to win the game? These also need to work with rewinding. It would be really nice if each flag gave some sort of debuff or buff.
